My name is Ismail. I like finding meaning in things. 

Mean, median, mode, and other statistical tools are quick ways of deriving such meaning from large quantities of information. 
That's why I pursued an MSc in Statistics from the University of Toronto (graduated June 2023).

Although I have completed many statistical analyses for school or work, this website will allow me to report any personal data analyses I do just for fun.  
Having just recently scraped 26,999 movies’ IMDb data, I’m excited to dig in and share cool findings on [here](/blog/). I also have data dashboard or app ideas every once in a while that I would add to the [portfolio](/portfolio/).

Also: as an aspiring data scientist or statistician, it's necessary to consider the ethics involved at each step of the data science process - from the data collection to the analysis/modelling to the interpretation. In many cases, the collection of numbers and letters in an Excel spreadsheet represent real people.
