**[LINK TO DASHBOARD: https://analitty.shinyapps.io/UNdilemma/](https://analitty.shinyapps.io/UNdilemma/)**


This dashboard was made for a friend who was was in the middle of a stressful (but good) dilemma of having two summer job offers from the United Nations: one was with a Bangkok-based team, and the other based in NYC.

It's a tool that is probably not relevant to your life, but in the future I plan on generalizing it to any 2 jobs, as well as other types of decisions: which of 2 restaurants to eat at, which of 2 shows to watch. It could really be anything.
