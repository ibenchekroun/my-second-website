This dashboard was made to allow anyone to answer the question, "Are movies getting longer?", the way they mean to. The dashboard covers all movies released from 1930 to 2022 with 1.5K+ ratings on IMDb, totalling to 29.9 thousand movies. You can filter these movies based on release year, budget, box office gross, director and other characteristics. Please note, however, that as in any analysis, the movies youâ€™re including (or excluding) should affect your interpretations accordingly.

A demo for the dashboard will be posted here soon.
