My name is Ismail. I like finding meaning in things. 

We learn at a young age that mean, median and mode are ways of deriving such meaning from large quantities of information. 
I think that's neat, but as we also learn at a young age, they have their problems. So I pursued an MSc in Statistics from the University of Toronto (graduated June 2023) to learn more.

Having just recently scraped 26,999 movies’ IMDb data, I’m excited to dig in and share cool findings on [here](/post/). I also have data dashboard or app ideas every once in a while that I would add to the [portfolio](/portfolio/).

For now, feel free to check out the [first data analysis](/post/imdb-review-bombing/) to come out fresh off the IMDb data and leave comments (am interested in hearing feedback and/or any ideas you may have).

Also: as an aspiring data scientist or statistician, it's necessary to consider the ethics involved at each step of the data science process - from the data collection to the analysis/modelling to the interpretation. In many cases, the collection of numbers and letters in an Excel spreadsheet represent real people.
